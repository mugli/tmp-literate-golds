<span class="comment"> Package build gathers information about Go packages.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> Go Path</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> The Go path is a list of directory trees containing Go source code.</span><span class="comment"> It is consulted to resolve imports that cannot be found in the standard</span><span class="comment"> Go tree. The default path is the value of the GOPATH environment</span><span class="comment"> variable, interpreted as a path list appropriate to the operating system</span><span class="comment"> (on Unix, the variable is a colon-separated string;</span><span class="comment"> on Windows, a semicolon-separated string;</span><span class="comment"> on Plan 9, a list).</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> Each directory listed in the Go path must have a prescribed structure:</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> The src/ directory holds source code. The path below 'src' determines</span><span class="comment"> the import path or executable name.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> The pkg/ directory holds installed package objects.</span><span class="comment"> As in the Go tree, each target operating system and</span><span class="comment"> architecture pair has its own subdirectory of pkg</span><span class="comment"> (pkg/GOOS_GOARCH).</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> If DIR is a directory listed in the Go path, a package with</span><span class="comment"> source in DIR/src/foo/bar can be imported as "foo/bar" and</span><span class="comment"> has its compiled form installed to "DIR/pkg/GOOS_GOARCH/foo/bar.a"</span><span class="comment"> (or, for gccgo, "DIR/pkg/gccgo/foo/libbar.a").</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> The bin/ directory holds compiled commands.</span><span class="comment"> Each command is named for its source directory, but only</span><span class="comment"> using the final element, not the entire path. That is, the</span><span class="comment"> command with source in DIR/src/foo/quux is installed into</span><span class="comment"> DIR/bin/quux, not DIR/bin/foo/quux. The foo/ is stripped</span><span class="comment"> so that you can add DIR/bin to your PATH to get at the</span><span class="comment"> installed commands.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> Here's an example directory layout:</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">	GOPATH=/home/user/gocode</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">	/home/user/gocode/</span><span class="comment">	    src/</span><span class="comment">	        foo/</span><span class="comment">	            bar/               (go code in package bar)</span><span class="comment">	                x.go</span><span class="comment">	            quux/              (go code in package main)</span><span class="comment">	                y.go</span><span class="comment">	    bin/</span><span class="comment">	        quux                   (installed command)</span><span class="comment">	    pkg/</span><span class="comment">	        linux_amd64/</span><span class="comment">	            foo/</span><span class="comment">	                bar.a          (installed package object)</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> Build Constraints</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> A build constraint, also known as a build tag, is a line comment that begins</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	// +build</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> that lists the conditions under which a file should be included in the</span><span class="comment"> package. Build constraints may also be part of a file's name</span><span class="comment"> (for example, source_windows.go will only be included if the target</span><span class="comment"> operating system is windows).</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> See 'go help buildconstraint'</span><span class="comment"> (https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Build_constraints) for details.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> Binary-Only Packages</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> In Go 1.12 and earlier, it was possible to distribute packages in binary</span><span class="comment"> form without including the source code used for compiling the package.</span><span class="comment"> The package was distributed with a source file not excluded by build</span><span class="comment"> constraints and containing a "//go:binary-only-package" comment. Like a</span><span class="comment"> build constraint, this comment appeared at the top of a file, preceded</span><span class="comment"> only by blank lines and other line comments and with a blank line</span><span class="comment"> following the comment, to separate it from the package documentation.</span><span class="comment"> Unlike build constraints, this comment is only recognized in non-test</span><span class="comment"> Go source files.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> The minimal source code for a binary-only package was therefore:</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">	//go:binary-only-package</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">	package mypkg</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> The source code could include additional Go code. That code was never</span><span class="comment"> compiled but would be processed by tools like godoc and might be useful</span><span class="comment"> as end-user documentation.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> "go build" and other commands no longer support binary-only-packages.</span><span class="comment"> Import and ImportDir will still set the BinaryOnly flag in packages</span><span class="comment"> containing these comments for use in tools and error messages.</span><span class="comment"></span></div>
