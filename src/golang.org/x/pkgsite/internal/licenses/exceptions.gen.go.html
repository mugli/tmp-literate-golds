<span class="lit-string">Preamble</span>

<span class="lit-string">The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software</span>
<span class="lit-string">and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the</span>
<span class="lit-string">community in the case of network server software.</span>

<span class="lit-string">The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take</span>
<span class="lit-string">away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public</span>
<span class="lit-string">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions</span>
<span class="lit-string">of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.</span>

<span class="lit-string">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our</span>
<span class="lit-string">General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to</span>
<span class="lit-string">distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you</span>
<span class="lit-string">receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the</span>
<span class="lit-string">software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do</span>
<span class="lit-string">these things.</span>

<span class="lit-string">Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two</span>
<span class="lit-string">steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the</span>
<span class="lit-string">software.</span>

<span class="lit-string">A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in</span>
<span class="lit-string">alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become</span>
<span class="lit-string">available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software</span>
<span class="lit-string">are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case</span>
<span class="lit-string">of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU</span>
<span class="lit-string">((Affero))??</span>
<span class="lit-string">General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public</span>
<span class="lit-string">access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.</span>

<span class="lit-string">The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that,</span>
<span class="lit-string">in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It</span>
<span class="lit-string">requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public</span>
<span class="lit-string">use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public</span>
<span class="lit-string">access to the source code of the modified version.</span>

<span class="lit-string">An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by</span>
<span class="lit-string">Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license,</span>
<span class="lit-string">not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.</span>

<span class="lit-string">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification</span>
<span class="lit-string">follow.</span>

<span class="lit-string">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Definitions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   works, such as semiconductor masks.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be</span>
<span class="lit-string">   individuals or organizations.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   or a work "based on" the earlier work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under</span>
<span class="lit-string">   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other</span>
<span class="lit-string">   activities as well.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties</span>
<span class="lit-string">   to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer</span>
<span class="lit-string">   network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)</span>
<span class="lit-string">   displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there</span>
<span class="lit-string">   is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are</span>
<span class="lit-string">   provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user</span>
<span class="lit-string">   commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this</span>
<span class="lit-string">   criterion.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Source Code.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard</span>
<span class="lit-string">   defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces</span>
<span class="lit-string">   specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used</span>
<span class="lit-string">   among developers working in that language.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only</span>
<span class="lit-string">   to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major</span>
<span class="lit-string">   essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific</span>
<span class="lit-string">   operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler</span>
<span class="lit-string">   used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those</span>
<span class="lit-string">   activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used</span>
<span class="lit-string">   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files</span>
<span class="lit-string">   associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared</span>
<span class="lit-string">   libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically</span>
<span class="lit-string">   designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow</span>
<span class="lit-string">   between those</span>

<span class="lit-string">   subprograms and other parts of the work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate</span>
<span class="lit-string">   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Basic Permissions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright</span>
<span class="lit-string">   on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this</span>
<span class="lit-string">   License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as</span>
<span class="lit-string">   provided by copyright law.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey</span>
<span class="lit-string">   covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running</span>
<span class="lit-string">   those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus</span>
<span class="lit-string">   making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your</span>
<span class="lit-string">   behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from</span>
<span class="lit-string">   making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship</span>
<span class="lit-string">   with you.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it</span>
<span class="lit-string">   unnecessary.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Protecting Users' Legal</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ((Rights || ACLs))</span>
<span class="lit-string">   From Anti-Circumvention Law.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure</span>
<span class="lit-string">   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   restricting circumvention of such measures.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</span>
<span class="lit-string">   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is</span>
<span class="lit-string">   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third</span>
<span class="lit-string">   parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Conveying Verbatim Copies.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive</span>
<span class="lit-string">   it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish</span>
<span class="lit-string">   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating</span>
<span class="lit-string">   that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7</span>
<span class="lit-string">   apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you</span>
<span class="lit-string">   may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Conveying Modified Source Versions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce</span>
<span class="lit-string">   it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,</span>
<span class="lit-string">      and giving a relevant date.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released</span>
<span class="lit-string">      under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This</span>
<span class="lit-string">      requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all</span>
<span class="lit-string">      notices".</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to</span>
<span class="lit-string">      anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore</span>
<span class="lit-string">      apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole</span>
<span class="lit-string">      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This</span>
<span class="lit-string">      License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it</span>
<span class="lit-string">      does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</span>
<span class="lit-string">      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need</span>
<span class="lit-string">      not make them do so.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are</span>
<span class="lit-string">   not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   other parts of the aggregate.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Conveying Non-Source Forms.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections</span>
<span class="lit-string">   4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span>
<span class="lit-string">      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used</span>
<span class="lit-string">      for software interchange.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span>
<span class="lit-string">      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written</span>
<span class="lit-string">      offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer</span>
<span class="lit-string">      spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who</span>
<span class="lit-string">      possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source</span>
<span class="lit-string">      for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a</span>
<span class="lit-string">      durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a</span>
<span class="lit-string">      price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</span>
<span class="lit-string">      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a</span>
<span class="lit-string">      network server at no charge.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is</span>
<span class="lit-string">      allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received</span>
<span class="lit-string">      the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place</span>
<span class="lit-string">      (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You</span>
<span class="lit-string">      need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with</span>
<span class="lit-string">      the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server,</span>
<span class="lit-string">      the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or</span>
<span class="lit-string">      a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you</span>
<span class="lit-string">      maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as</span>
<span class="lit-string">      needed to satisfy these requirements.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you</span>
<span class="lit-string">      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection</span>
<span class="lit-string">      6d.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conveying the object code work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible</span>
<span class="lit-string">   personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household</span>
<span class="lit-string">   purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall</span>
<span class="lit-string">   be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless</span>
<span class="lit-string">   such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified</span>
<span class="lit-string">   version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure</span>
<span class="lit-string">   that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case</span>
<span class="lit-string">   prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is</span>
<span class="lit-string">   transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed</span>
<span class="lit-string">   under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the work has been installed in ROM).</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for</span>
<span class="lit-string">   a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may</span>
<span class="lit-string">   be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for</span>
<span class="lit-string">   communication across the network.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and</span>
<span class="lit-string">   with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must</span>
<span class="lit-string">   require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Additional Terms.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">   by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as</span>
<span class="lit-string">   though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid</span>
<span class="lit-string">   under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   additional permissions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added</span>
<span class="lit-string">   by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copyright permission.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</span>
<span class="lit-string">      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices</span>
<span class="lit-string">      displayed by works containing it; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable</span>
<span class="lit-string">      ways as different from the original version; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</span>
<span class="lit-string">      authors of the material; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade</span>
<span class="lit-string">      names, trademarks, or service marks; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material</span>
<span class="lit-string">      by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with</span>
<span class="lit-string">      contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability</span>
<span class="lit-string">      that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and</span>
<span class="lit-string">      authors.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further</span>
<span class="lit-string">   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you</span>
<span class="lit-string">   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed</span>
<span class="lit-string">   by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may</span>
<span class="lit-string">   remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">   work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must</span>
<span class="lit-string">   place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable</span>
<span class="lit-string">   terms.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements</span>
<span class="lit-string">   apply either way.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Termination.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided</span>
<span class="lit-string">   under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including</span>
<span class="lit-string">   any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</span>

<span class="lit-string">   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by</span>
<span class="lit-string">   some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some</span>
<span class="lit-string">   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you</span>
<span class="lit-string">   cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If</span>
<span class="lit-string">   your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not</span>
<span class="lit-string">   qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise</span>
<span class="lit-string">   does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions</span>
<span class="lit-string">   infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying</span>
<span class="lit-string">   or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">   to do so.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by</span>
<span class="lit-string">   third parties with this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an</span>
<span class="lit-string">   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</span>
<span class="lit-string">   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who</span>
<span class="lit-string">   receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous</span>
<span class="lit-string">   paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it</span>
<span class="lit-string">   with reasonable efforts.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights</span>
<span class="lit-string">   granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by</span>
<span class="lit-string">   making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   portion of it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Patents.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus</span>
<span class="lit-string">   licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter</span>
<span class="lit-string">   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include</span>
<span class="lit-string">   claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"</span>
<span class="lit-string">   includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the requirements of this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent</span>
<span class="lit-string">   license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of its contributor version.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express</span>
<span class="lit-string">   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such</span>
<span class="lit-string">   as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to s ue for</span>
<span class="lit-string">   patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   party.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available</span>
<span class="lit-string">   network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)</span>
<span class="lit-string">   cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive</span>
<span class="lit-string">   yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   extend the patent</span>

<span class="lit-string">   license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual</span>
<span class="lit-string">   knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would</span>
<span class="lit-string">   infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have</span>
<span class="lit-string">   reason to believe are valid.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and</span>
<span class="lit-string">   grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an</span>
<span class="lit-string">   arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing</span>
<span class="lit-string">   software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party</span>
<span class="lit-string">   grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">   work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent</span>
<span class="lit-string">   license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be</span>
<span class="lit-string">   available to you under applicable patent law.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</span>

<span class="lit-string">   not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">   would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ((Affero))??</span>
<span class="lit-string">   General Public License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting</span>
<span class="lit-string">   with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such</span>
<span class="lit-string">   interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your</span>
<span class="lit-string">   version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server</span>
<span class="lit-string">   at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ((Affero))??</span>
<span class="lit-string">   General</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to</span>

<span class="lit-string">   GNU</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ((Affero))??</span>
<span class="lit-string">   General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part</span>
<span class="lit-string">   which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain</span>
<span class="lit-string">   governed by version 3 of the GNU</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ((Affero))??</span>
<span class="lit-string">   General Public License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Revised Versions of this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will</span>
<span class="lit-string">   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   address new problems or concerns.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program</span>
<span class="lit-string">   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public</span>
<span class="lit-string">   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any</span>

<span class="lit-string">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</span>

<span class="lit-string">If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use</span>
<span class="lit-string">to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which</span>
<span class="lit-string">everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span>

<span class="lit-string">To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach</span>
<span class="lit-string">them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of</span>
<span class="lit-string">warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer</span>
<span class="lit-string">to where the full notice is found.</span>

<span class="lit-string">If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network,</span>
<span class="lit-string">you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.</span>
<span class="lit-string">For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a</span>

<span class="lit-string">you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different</span>

<span class="lit-string">   be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence</span>
<span class="lit-string">   unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the</span>

<span class="lit-string">Preamble</span>

<span class="lit-string">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share</span>
<span class="lit-string">and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to</span>
<span class="lit-string">guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the</span>
<span class="lit-string">software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most</span>
<span class="lit-string">of the __5__ and to any other program whose</span>
<span class="lit-string">authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is</span>
<span class="lit-string">covered by the GNU</span>
<span class="lit-string">((Lesser||Library))</span>
<span class="lit-string">General Public License instead.) You can apply it to</span>
<span class="lit-string">your programs, too.</span>

<span class="lit-string">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our</span>
<span class="lit-string">General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to</span>
<span class="lit-string">distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),</span>
<span class="lit-string">that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change</span>
<span class="lit-string">the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can</span>
<span class="lit-string">do these things.</span>

<span class="lit-string">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny</span>
<span class="lit-string">you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions</span>
<span class="lit-string">translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">software, or if you modify it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a</span>
<span class="lit-string">fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make</span>
<span class="lit-string">sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them</span>
<span class="lit-string">these terms so they know their rights.</span>

<span class="lit-string">We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer</span>
<span class="lit-string">you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or</span>
<span class="lit-string">modify the software.</span>

<span class="lit-string">Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that</span>
<span class="lit-string">everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the</span>
<span class="lit-string">software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to</span>
<span class="lit-string">know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by</span>
<span class="lit-string">others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</span>

<span class="lit-string">Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish</span>
<span class="lit-string">to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually</span>
<span class="lit-string">obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent</span>
<span class="lit-string">this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free</span>
<span class="lit-string">use or not licensed at all.</span>

<span class="lit-string">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification</span>
<span class="lit-string">follow.</span>

<span class="lit-string">__5__ TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ This License applies to any program or other work which contains a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each</span>
<span class="lit-string">   licensee is addressed as "you".</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program</span>
<span class="lit-string">   is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its</span>
<span class="lit-string">   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been</span>
<span class="lit-string">   made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program does.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source</span>
<span class="lit-string">   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</span>
<span class="lit-string">   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and</span>
<span class="lit-string">   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this</span>
<span class="lit-string">   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may</span>
<span class="lit-string">   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you</span>
<span class="lit-string">   also meet all of these conditions:</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating</span>
<span class="lit-string">      that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</span>
<span class="lit-string">      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part</span>
<span class="lit-string">      thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under</span>
<span class="lit-string">      the terms of this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when</span>
<span class="lit-string">      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in</span>
<span class="lit-string">      the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an</span>
<span class="lit-string">      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or</span>
<span class="lit-string">      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute</span>
<span class="lit-string">      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a</span>
<span class="lit-string">      copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span>
<span class="lit-string">      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span>

<span class="lit-string">   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable</span>
<span class="lit-string">   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably</span>
<span class="lit-string">   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as</span>
<span class="lit-string">   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole</span>
<span class="lit-string">   which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be</span>
<span class="lit-string">   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</span>
<span class="lit-string">   it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your</span>
<span class="lit-string">   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this</span>
<span class="lit-string">   License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source</span>
<span class="lit-string">      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above</span>
<span class="lit-string">      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,</span>
<span class="lit-string">      to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically</span>
<span class="lit-string">      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1</span>
<span class="lit-string">      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to</span>
<span class="lit-string">      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only</span>
<span class="lit-string">      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in</span>
<span class="lit-string">      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Subsection b above.)</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface</span>
<span class="lit-string">   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and</span>
<span class="lit-string">   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source</span>
<span class="lit-string">   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   component itself accompanies the executable.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   object code.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except</span>
<span class="lit-string">   as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically</span>
<span class="lit-string">   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</span>
<span class="lit-string">   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed</span>
<span class="lit-string">   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you</span>
<span class="lit-string">   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original</span>
<span class="lit-string">   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'</span>
<span class="lit-string">   exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing</span>
<span class="lit-string">   compliance by third parties to this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
<span class="lit-string">   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other</span>
<span class="lit-string">   pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit</span>
<span class="lit-string">   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies</span>
<span class="lit-string">   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both</span>
<span class="lit-string">   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents</span>
<span class="lit-string">   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free</span>
<span class="lit-string">   software distribution system, which is implemented by public license</span>
<span class="lit-string">   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent</span>
<span class="lit-string">   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee</span>
<span class="lit-string">   cannot impose that choice.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   consequence of the rest of this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain</span>
<span class="lit-string">   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an</span>
<span class="lit-string">   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so</span>
<span class="lit-string">   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   body of this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be</span>
<span class="lit-string">   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address</span>
<span class="lit-string">   new problems or concerns.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program</span>
<span class="lit-string">   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later</span>
<span class="lit-string">   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   that version or of any later version published by the Free Software</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</span>
<span class="lit-string">   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make</span>

<span class="lit-string">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</span>

<span class="lit-string">If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use</span>
<span class="lit-string">to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which</span>
<span class="lit-string">everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span>

<span class="lit-string">To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach</span>
<span class="lit-string">them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion</span>
<span class="lit-string">of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a</span>
<span class="lit-string">pointer to where the full notice is found.</span>

<span class="lit-string">Preamble</span>

<span class="lit-string">The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and</span>
<span class="lit-string">other kinds of works.</span>

<span class="lit-string">The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take</span>
<span class="lit-string">away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General</span>
<span class="lit-string">Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all</span>
<span class="lit-string">versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.</span>
<span class="lit-string">We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of</span>
<span class="lit-string">our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its</span>
<span class="lit-string">authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</span>

<span class="lit-string">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our</span>
<span class="lit-string">General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to</span>
<span class="lit-string">distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you</span>
<span class="lit-string">receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the</span>
<span class="lit-string">software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do</span>
<span class="lit-string">these things.</span>

<span class="lit-string">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights</span>
<span class="lit-string">or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain</span>
<span class="lit-string">responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:</span>
<span class="lit-string">responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</span>

<span class="lit-string">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a</span>
<span class="lit-string">fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You</span>
<span class="lit-string">must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must</span>
<span class="lit-string">show them these terms so they know their rights.</span>

<span class="lit-string">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert</span>
<span class="lit-string">copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal</span>
<span class="lit-string">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there</span>
<span class="lit-string">is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the</span>
<span class="lit-string">GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems</span>
<span class="lit-string">will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified</span>
<span class="lit-string">versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This</span>
<span class="lit-string">is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to</span>
<span class="lit-string">change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of</span>
<span class="lit-string">products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most</span>
<span class="lit-string">unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit</span>
<span class="lit-string">the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other</span>
<span class="lit-string">domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future</span>
<span class="lit-string">versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</span>

<span class="lit-string">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States</span>
<span class="lit-string">should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on</span>
<span class="lit-string">general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special</span>
<span class="lit-string">danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively</span>
<span class="lit-string">proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to</span>
<span class="lit-string">render the program non-free.</span>

<span class="lit-string">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification</span>
<span class="lit-string">follow.</span>

<span class="lit-string">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Definitions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   works, such as semiconductor masks.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Each licensee is addressed as __1__. "Licensees" and "recipients" may be</span>
<span class="lit-string">   individuals or organizations.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   or a work "based on" the earlier work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under</span>
<span class="lit-string">   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other</span>
<span class="lit-string">   activities as well.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties</span>
<span class="lit-string">   to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer</span>
<span class="lit-string">   network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)</span>
<span class="lit-string">   displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there</span>
<span class="lit-string">   is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are</span>
<span class="lit-string">   provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user</span>
<span class="lit-string">   commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this</span>
<span class="lit-string">   criterion.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Source Code.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard</span>
<span class="lit-string">   defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces</span>
<span class="lit-string">   specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used</span>
<span class="lit-string">   among developers working in that language.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only</span>
<span class="lit-string">   to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major</span>
<span class="lit-string">   essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific</span>
<span class="lit-string">   operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler</span>
<span class="lit-string">   used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those</span>
<span class="lit-string">   activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used</span>
<span class="lit-string">   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files</span>
<span class="lit-string">   associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared</span>
<span class="lit-string">   libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically</span>
<span class="lit-string">   designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow</span>
<span class="lit-string">   between those subprograms and other parts of the work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate</span>
<span class="lit-string">   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Basic Permissions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright</span>
<span class="lit-string">   on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this</span>
<span class="lit-string">   License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as</span>
<span class="lit-string">   provided by copyright law.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey</span>
<span class="lit-string">   covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running</span>
<span class="lit-string">   those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus</span>
<span class="lit-string">   making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your</span>
<span class="lit-string">   behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from</span>
<span class="lit-string">   making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship</span>
<span class="lit-string">   with you.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it</span>
<span class="lit-string">   unnecessary.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure</span>
<span class="lit-string">   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   restricting circumvention of such measures.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</span>
<span class="lit-string">   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is</span>
<span class="lit-string">   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third</span>
<span class="lit-string">   parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Conveying Verbatim Copies.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive</span>
<span class="lit-string">   it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish</span>
<span class="lit-string">   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating</span>
<span class="lit-string">   that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7</span>
<span class="lit-string">   apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you</span>
<span class="lit-string">   may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Conveying Modified Source Versions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce</span>
<span class="lit-string">   it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,</span>
<span class="lit-string">      and giving a relevant date.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released</span>
<span class="lit-string">      under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This</span>
<span class="lit-string">      requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all</span>
<span class="lit-string">      notices".</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to</span>
<span class="lit-string">      anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore</span>
<span class="lit-string">      apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole</span>
<span class="lit-string">      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This</span>
<span class="lit-string">      License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it</span>
<span class="lit-string">      does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</span>
<span class="lit-string">      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need</span>
<span class="lit-string">      not make them do so.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are</span>
<span class="lit-string">   not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   other parts of the aggregate.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Conveying Non-Source Forms.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections</span>
<span class="lit-string">   4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span>
<span class="lit-string">      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used</span>
<span class="lit-string">      for software interchange.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span>
<span class="lit-string">      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written</span>
<span class="lit-string">      offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer</span>
<span class="lit-string">      spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who</span>
<span class="lit-string">      possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source</span>
<span class="lit-string">      for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a</span>
<span class="lit-string">      durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a</span>
<span class="lit-string">      price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</span>
<span class="lit-string">      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a</span>
<span class="lit-string">      network server at no charge.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is</span>
<span class="lit-string">      allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received</span>
<span class="lit-string">      the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place</span>
<span class="lit-string">      (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You</span>
<span class="lit-string">      need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with</span>
<span class="lit-string">      the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server,</span>
<span class="lit-string">      the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or</span>
<span class="lit-string">      a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you</span>
<span class="lit-string">      maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as</span>
<span class="lit-string">      needed to satisfy these requirements.</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you</span>
<span class="lit-string">      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection</span>
<span class="lit-string">      6d.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   conveying the object code work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible</span>
<span class="lit-string">   personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household</span>
<span class="lit-string">   purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall</span>
<span class="lit-string">   be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless</span>
<span class="lit-string">   such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute</span>
<span class="lit-string">   modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified</span>
<span class="lit-string">   version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure</span>
<span class="lit-string">   that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case</span>
<span class="lit-string">   prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is</span>
<span class="lit-string">   transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed</span>
<span class="lit-string">   under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the work has been installed in ROM).</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for</span>
<span class="lit-string">   a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may</span>
<span class="lit-string">   be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for</span>
<span class="lit-string">   communication across the network.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and</span>
<span class="lit-string">   with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must</span>
<span class="lit-string">   require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Additional Terms.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">   by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as</span>
<span class="lit-string">   though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid</span>
<span class="lit-string">   under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   additional permissions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added</span>
<span class="lit-string">   by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate</span>
<span class="lit-string">   copyright permission.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</span>
<span class="lit-string">      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</span>
<span class="lit-string">      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices</span>
<span class="lit-string">      displayed by works containing it; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable</span>
<span class="lit-string">      ways as different from the original version; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</span>
<span class="lit-string">      authors of the material; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade</span>
<span class="lit-string">      names, trademarks, or service marks; or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      __1__ Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material</span>
<span class="lit-string">      by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with</span>
<span class="lit-string">      contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability</span>
<span class="lit-string">      that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and</span>
<span class="lit-string">      authors.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further</span>
<span class="lit-string">   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you</span>
<span class="lit-string">   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed</span>
<span class="lit-string">   by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may</span>
<span class="lit-string">   remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">   work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must</span>
<span class="lit-string">   place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable</span>
<span class="lit-string">   terms.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements</span>
<span class="lit-string">   apply either way.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Termination.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided</span>
<span class="lit-string">   under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including</span>
<span class="lit-string">   any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</span>

<span class="lit-string">   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by</span>
<span class="lit-string">   some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated</span>
<span class="lit-string">   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some</span>
<span class="lit-string">   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you</span>
<span class="lit-string">   cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If</span>
<span class="lit-string">   your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not</span>
<span class="lit-string">   qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise</span>
<span class="lit-string">   does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions</span>
<span class="lit-string">   infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying</span>
<span class="lit-string">   or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">   to do so.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by</span>
<span class="lit-string">   third parties with this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an</span>
<span class="lit-string">   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</span>
<span class="lit-string">   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who</span>
<span class="lit-string">   receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous</span>
<span class="lit-string">   paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it</span>
<span class="lit-string">   with reasonable efforts.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights</span>
<span class="lit-string">   granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by</span>
<span class="lit-string">   making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   portion of it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Patents.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus</span>
<span class="lit-string">   licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter</span>
<span class="lit-string">   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include</span>
<span class="lit-string">   claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"</span>
<span class="lit-string">   includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the requirements of this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent</span>
<span class="lit-string">   license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of its contributor version.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express</span>
<span class="lit-string">   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such</span>
<span class="lit-string">   as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for</span>
<span class="lit-string">   patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   party.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available</span>
<span class="lit-string">   network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)</span>
<span class="lit-string">   cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive</span>
<span class="lit-string">   yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in</span>
<span class="lit-string">   a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country</span>
<span class="lit-string">   that you have reason to believe are valid.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and</span>
<span class="lit-string">   grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an</span>
<span class="lit-string">   arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing</span>
<span class="lit-string">   software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party</span>
<span class="lit-string">   grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">   work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for</span>
<span class="lit-string">   and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent</span>
<span class="lit-string">   license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be</span>
<span class="lit-string">   available to you under applicable patent law.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse</span>
<span class="lit-string">   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work</span>
<span class="lit-string">   so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at</span>
<span class="lit-string">   all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to</span>
<span class="lit-string">   link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU</span>
<span class="lit-string">   Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   network will apply to the combination as such.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Revised Versions of this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be</span>
<span class="lit-string">   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address</span>
<span class="lit-string">   new problems or concerns.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program</span>
<span class="lit-string">   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License</span>
<span class="lit-string">   "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version</span>
<span class="lit-string">   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the Program.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright</span>
<span class="lit-string">   holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Disclaimer of Warranty.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE</span>
<span class="lit-string">   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</span>
<span class="lit-string">   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED</span>
<span class="lit-string">   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY</span>
<span class="lit-string">   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Limitation of Liability.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE</span>
<span class="lit-string">   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY</span>
<span class="lit-string">   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE</span>
<span class="lit-string">   OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR</span>
<span class="lit-string">   DATA BEING RENDERED</span>
<span class="lit-string">   ((INACCURATE || INADURATE))</span>
<span class="lit-string">   OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR</span>

<span class="lit-string">   HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   __1__ Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above</span>
<span class="lit-string">   cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts</span>
<span class="lit-string">   shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of</span>

<span class="lit-string">If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use</span>
<span class="lit-string">to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which</span>
<span class="lit-string">everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span>

<span class="lit-string">To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach</span>
<span class="lit-string">them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of</span>
<span class="lit-string">warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer</span>
<span class="lit-string">to where the full notice is found.</span>

<span class="lit-string">__30__</span>
<span class="lit-string">//**</span>
<span class="lit-string">&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span>
<span class="lit-string">Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</span>
<span class="lit-string">**//</span>

<span class="lit-string">This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under</span>
<span class="lit-string">the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software</span>
<span class="lit-string">Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later</span>
<span class="lit-string">version.</span>

<span class="lit-string">This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY</span>
<span class="lit-string">WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A</span>
<span class="lit-string">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.</span>

<span class="lit-string">You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with</span>
<span class="lit-string">this program. If not, see &lt;https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</span>

<span class="lit-string">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</span>

<span class="lit-string">If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like</span>
<span class="lit-string">this when it starts in an interactive mode:</span>

<span class="lit-string">&lt;program&gt; __10__</span>

<span class="lit-string">This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `</span> + <span class="lit-string">"`"</span> + <span class="lit-string">`show w'.</span>

<span class="lit-string">This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain</span>
<span class="lit-string">conditions; type `</span> + <span class="lit-string">"`"</span> + <span class="lit-string">`show c' for details.</span>

<span class="lit-string">The hypothetical commands `</span> + <span class="lit-string">"`"</span> + <span class="lit-string">`show w' and `</span> + <span class="lit-string">"`"</span> + <span class="lit-string">`show c' should show the appropriate</span>
<span class="lit-string">parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be</span>
<span class="lit-string">different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".</span>

<span class="lit-string">You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if</span>
<span class="lit-string">any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more</span>
<span class="lit-string">information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</span>

<span class="lit-string">The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into</span>
<span class="lit-string">proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider</span>
<span class="lit-string">it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If</span>
<span class="lit-string">this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead</span>

<span class="lit-string">(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;</span>
<span class="lit-string">    or</span>

<span class="lit-string">(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of</span>
<span class="lit-string">    its Contributions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,</span>

<span class="lit-string">permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</span>

<span class="lit-string">2.5. Representation</span>

<span class="lit-string">2.6. Fair Use</span>

<span class="lit-string">This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under</span>

<span class="lit-string">in Section 2.1.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3. Responsibilities</span>
<span class="lit-string">-------------------</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</span>

<span class="lit-string">All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any</span>
<span class="lit-string">Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under</span>
<span class="lit-string">the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source</span>
<span class="lit-string">Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this</span>
<span class="lit-string">License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not</span>
<span class="lit-string">attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code</span>
<span class="lit-string">Form.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</span>

<span class="lit-string">If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</span>

<span class="lit-string">(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code</span>
<span class="lit-string">    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of</span>
<span class="lit-string">    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code</span>
<span class="lit-string">    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more</span>
<span class="lit-string">    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</span>

<span class="lit-string">(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this</span>
<span class="lit-string">    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the</span>
<span class="lit-string">    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter</span>
<span class="lit-string">    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</span>

<span class="lit-string">You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,</span>
<span class="lit-string">provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for</span>
<span class="lit-string">the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the</span>
<span class="lit-string">Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this</span>
<span class="lit-string">License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software</span>
<span class="lit-string">under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of</span>
<span class="lit-string">the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary</span>
<span class="lit-string">License(s).</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.4. Notices</span>

<span class="lit-string">You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices</span>
<span class="lit-string">(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,</span>
<span class="lit-string">or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of</span>
<span class="lit-string">the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to</span>
<span class="lit-string">the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.5. Application of Additional Terms</span>

<span class="lit-string">You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,</span>
<span class="lit-string">indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on</span>
<span class="lit-string">behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any</span>
<span class="lit-string">such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by</span>
<span class="lit-string">You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any</span>
<span class="lit-string">liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,</span>
<span class="lit-string">indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional</span>
<span class="lit-string">disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any</span>
<span class="lit-string">jurisdiction.</span>

<span class="lit-string">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</span>
<span class="lit-string">---------------------------------------------------</span>

<span class="lit-string">If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this</span>
<span class="lit-string">License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to</span>
<span class="lit-string">statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with</span>
<span class="lit-string">the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)</span>
<span class="lit-string">describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must</span>
<span class="lit-string">be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute</span>
<span class="lit-string">or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a</span>
<span class="lit-string">recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5. Termination</span>
<span class="lit-string">--------------</span>

<span class="lit-string">5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically</span>
<span class="lit-string">if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become</span>
<span class="lit-string">compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular</span>
<span class="lit-string">Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such</span>
<span class="lit-string">Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an</span>
<span class="lit-string">ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have</span>
<span class="lit-string">come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular</span>
<span class="lit-string">Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor</span>
<span class="lit-string">notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the</span>
<span class="lit-string">first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after</span>
<span class="lit-string">Your receipt of the notice.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent</span>
<span class="lit-string">infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,</span>
<span class="lit-string">counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version</span>
<span class="lit-string">directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to</span>
<span class="lit-string">You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section</span>
<span class="lit-string">2.1 of this License shall terminate.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all</span>
<span class="lit-string">end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which</span>
<span class="lit-string">have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">prior to termination shall survive termination.</span>

<span class="lit-string">You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the</span>
<span class="lit-string">Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the</span>
<span class="lit-string">Source Code Form under this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work You may create and distribute a Larger Work</span>
<span class="lit-string">under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements</span>
<span class="lit-string">of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of</span>
<span class="lit-string">Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the</span>
<span class="lit-string">Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of</span>
<span class="lit-string">such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at</span>
<span class="lit-string">their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either</span>
<span class="lit-string">this License or such Secondary License(s).</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.4. Notices You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices</span>
<span class="lit-string">(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required</span>
<span class="lit-string">to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.5. Application of Additional Terms You may choose to offer, and to charge a</span>
<span class="lit-string">fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more</span>
<span class="lit-string">recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,</span>
<span class="lit-string">and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any</span>
<span class="lit-string">such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You</span>
<span class="lit-string">alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability</span>
<span class="lit-string">incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or</span>
<span class="lit-string">liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty</span>
<span class="lit-string">and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</span>

<span class="lit-string">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You</span>
<span class="lit-string">to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of</span>
<span class="lit-string">the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You</span>
<span class="lit-string">must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;</span>
<span class="lit-string">and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must</span>
<span class="lit-string">be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software</span>
<span class="lit-string">under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,</span>
<span class="lit-string">such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill</span>
<span class="lit-string">to be able to understand it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5. Termination 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate</span>
<span class="lit-string">automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You</span>
<span class="lit-string">become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular</span>
<span class="lit-string">Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor</span>
<span class="lit-string">explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if</span>
<span class="lit-string">such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable</span>
<span class="lit-string">means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your</span>
<span class="lit-string">grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such</span>
<span class="lit-string">Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is</span>
<span class="lit-string">the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from</span>
<span class="lit-string">such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt</span>
<span class="lit-string">of the notice.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent</span>
<span class="lit-string">infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and</span>
<span class="lit-string">cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly</span>
<span class="lit-string">infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors</span>
<span class="lit-string">for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user</span>
<span class="lit-string">license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been</span>
<span class="lit-string">validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to</span>
<span class="lit-string">termination shall survive termination.</span>

<span class="lit-string">6. Disclaimer of Warranty Covered Software is provided under this License on an</span>
<span class="lit-string">“as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software</span>
<span class="lit-string">is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or</span>
<span class="lit-string">non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any</span>
<span class="lit-string">respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,</span>
<span class="lit-string">repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part</span>
<span class="lit-string">of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">except under this disclaimer.</span>

<span class="lit-string">7. Limitation of Liability Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,</span>
<span class="lit-string">whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any</span>
<span class="lit-string">Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be</span>
<span class="lit-string">liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential</span>
<span class="lit-string">damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost</span>
<span class="lit-string">profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have</span>
<span class="lit-string">been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability</span>
<span class="lit-string">shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such</span>
<span class="lit-string">party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some</span>
<span class="lit-string">jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or</span>
<span class="lit-string">consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</span>

<span class="lit-string">8. Litigation Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the</span>
<span class="lit-string">courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of</span>
<span class="lit-string">business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,</span>
<span class="lit-string">without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section</span>
<span class="lit-string">shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</span>

<span class="lit-string">9. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning the</span>
<span class="lit-string">subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be</span>
<span class="lit-string">unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to</span>
<span class="lit-string">make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a</span>
<span class="lit-string">contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe</span>
<span class="lit-string">this License against a Contributor.</span>

<span class="lit-string">10. Versions of the License 10.1. New Versions Mozilla Foundation is the license</span>
<span class="lit-string">steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license</span>

<span class="lit-string">10.2. Effect of New Versions You may distribute the Covered Software under the</span>

<span class="lit-string">references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified</span>
<span class="lit-string">license differs from this License).</span>

<span class="lit-string">      support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights</span>
<span class="lit-string">      consistent with this License.  However, in accepting such obligations, You</span>
<span class="lit-string">      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on</span>

<span class="lit-string">      any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by</span>
<span class="lit-string">      reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="lit-string">  14. General.</span>

<span class="lit-string">    (b) Export Control.  You shall comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt</span>

<span class="lit-string">The reasoning behind chosing AGPL license is explained in this [blog</span>
<span class="lit-string">post](https://blog.dgraph.io/post/licensing/). The general idea is that using</span>

<span class="lit-string">modifications to the server code back to the community.</span>

<span class="lit-string">Most users don't need to modify server code, so they can continue to use Dgraph</span>
<span class="lit-string">for free, forever.  But, if you need to modify server code and are not ok with</span>
<span class="lit-string">releasing the changes back, [get in touch](mailto:contact@dgraph.io) with us and</span>
<span class="lit-string">we can set you up with a commercial or enterprise license.</span>

<span class="lit-string">If use of our drivers under the Apache 2.0 or the database under the AGPL v3</span>
<span class="lit-string">does not satisfy your organization's legal department, commercial licenses are</span>

<span class="lit-string">     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,</span>
<span class="lit-string">     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with</span>

<span class="lit-string">2.4. Subsequent Licenses</span>

<span class="lit-string">     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to</span>
<span class="lit-string">     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this</span>
<span class="lit-string">     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if</span>
<span class="lit-string">     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</span>

<span class="lit-string">2.6. Fair Use</span>

<span class="lit-string">     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under</span>

<span class="lit-string">     equivalents.</span>

<span class="lit-string">2.7. Conditions</span>

<span class="lit-string">     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Section 2.1.</span>


<span class="lit-string">3. Responsibilities</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</span>

<span class="lit-string">     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under</span>
<span class="lit-string">     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this</span>
<span class="lit-string">     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not</span>
<span class="lit-string">     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Form.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</span>

<span class="lit-string">     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</span>

<span class="lit-string">     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,</span>
<span class="lit-string">        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by</span>
<span class="lit-string">        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost</span>
<span class="lit-string">        of distribution to the recipient; and</span>

<span class="lit-string">     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this</span>
<span class="lit-string">        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the</span>
<span class="lit-string">        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the</span>
<span class="lit-string">        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</span>

<span class="lit-string">     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,</span>
<span class="lit-string">     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for</span>
<span class="lit-string">     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this</span>
<span class="lit-string">     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software</span>
<span class="lit-string">     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of</span>
<span class="lit-string">     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary</span>
<span class="lit-string">     License(s).</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.4. Notices</span>

<span class="lit-string">     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices</span>
<span class="lit-string">     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or</span>
<span class="lit-string">     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the</span>
<span class="lit-string">     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.5. Application of Additional Terms</span>

<span class="lit-string">     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,</span>
<span class="lit-string">     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on</span>
<span class="lit-string">     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any</span>
<span class="lit-string">     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by</span>
<span class="lit-string">     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any</span>
<span class="lit-string">     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,</span>
<span class="lit-string">     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional</span>
<span class="lit-string">     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any</span>
<span class="lit-string">     jurisdiction.</span>

<span class="lit-string">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</span>

<span class="lit-string">   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License</span>
<span class="lit-string">   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the</span>
<span class="lit-string">   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a</span>
<span class="lit-string">   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary</span>
<span class="lit-string">   skill to be able to understand it.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5. Termination</span>

<span class="lit-string">5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You</span>
<span class="lit-string">     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,</span>
<span class="lit-string">     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor</span>
<span class="lit-string">     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor</span>
<span class="lit-string">     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing</span>
<span class="lit-string">     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by</span>
<span class="lit-string">     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into</span>
<span class="lit-string">     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are</span>
<span class="lit-string">     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the</span>
<span class="lit-string">     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have</span>
<span class="lit-string">     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such</span>
<span class="lit-string">     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt</span>
<span class="lit-string">     of the notice.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent</span>
<span class="lit-string">     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,</span>
<span class="lit-string">     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version</span>
<span class="lit-string">     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to</span>
<span class="lit-string">     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section</span>
<span class="lit-string">     2.1 of this License shall terminate.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user</span>
<span class="lit-string">     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been</span>
<span class="lit-string">     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to</span>
<span class="lit-string">     termination shall survive termination.</span>

<span class="lit-string">6. Disclaimer of Warranty</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.</span>
<span class="lit-string">   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software</span>
<span class="lit-string">   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,</span>
<span class="lit-string">   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential</span>
<span class="lit-string">   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under</span>
<span class="lit-string">   this License except under this disclaimer.</span>

<span class="lit-string">7. Limitation of Liability</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including</span>
<span class="lit-string">   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who</span>
<span class="lit-string">   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any</span>
<span class="lit-string">   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
<span class="lit-string">   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been</span>
<span class="lit-string">   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability</span>
<span class="lit-string">   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from</span>
<span class="lit-string">   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such</span>
<span class="lit-string">   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may</span>
<span class="lit-string">   not apply to You.</span>

<span class="lit-string">8. Litigation</span>

<span class="lit-string">   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts</span>
<span class="lit-string">   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of</span>
<span class="lit-string">   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing</span>
<span class="lit-string">   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or</span>
<span class="lit-string">   counter-claims.</span>

<span class="lit-string">9. Miscellaneous</span>

<span class="lit-string">   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject</span>
<span class="lit-string">   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be</span>
<span class="lit-string">   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent</span>
<span class="lit-string">   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that</span>
<span class="lit-string">   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not</span>
<span class="lit-string">   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</span>


<span class="lit-string">10. Versions of the License</span>

<span class="lit-string">10.1. New Versions</span>

<span class="lit-string">      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section</span>
<span class="lit-string">      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or</span>

<span class="lit-string">      distinguishing version number.</span>

<span class="lit-string">10.2. Effect of New Versions</span>

<span class="lit-string">      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version</span>
<span class="lit-string">      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,</span>
<span class="lit-string">      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license</span>
<span class="lit-string">      steward.</span>

<span class="lit-string">10.3. Modified Versions</span>

<span class="lit-string">      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to</span>
<span class="lit-string">      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a</span>
<span class="lit-string">      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove</span>
<span class="lit-string">      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that</span>
<span class="lit-string">      such modified license differs from this License).</span>

<span class="lit-string">10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is</span>
<span class="lit-string">      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of</span>

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="lit-string">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</span>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. </span>

<span class="lit-string">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. </span>

<span class="lit-string">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

<span class="lit-string">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="lit-string">1.under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and</span>

<span class="lit-string">2.2. Effective Date</span>

<span class="lit-string">The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.</span>
<span class="lit-string">2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</span>

<span class="lit-string">The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:</span>
<span class="lit-string">1.for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or</span>
<span class="lit-string">2.for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or</span>
<span class="lit-string">3.under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.</span>
<span class="lit-string">This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</span>
<span class="lit-string">2.4. Subsequent Licenses</span>

<span class="lit-string">No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</span>
<span class="lit-string">2.5. Representation</span>

<span class="lit-string">Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</span>
<span class="lit-string">2.6. Fair Use</span>

<span class="lit-string">This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.</span>
<span class="lit-string">2.7. Conditions</span>

<span class="lit-string">Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.</span>
<span class="lit-string">3. Responsibilities</span>

<span class="lit-string">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</span>

<span class="lit-string">All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.</span>
<span class="lit-string">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</span>

<span class="lit-string">If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</span>
<span class="lit-string">1.such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</span>
<span class="lit-string">2.You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</span>
<span class="lit-string">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</span>

<span class="lit-string">You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).</span>
<span class="lit-string">3.4. Notices</span>

<span class="lit-string">You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</span>
<span class="lit-string">3.5. Application of Additional Terms</span>

<span class="lit-string">You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</span>
<span class="lit-string">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</span>

<span class="lit-string">If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</span>
<span class="lit-string">5. Termination</span>

<span class="lit-string">5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</span>
<span class="lit-string">5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.</span>
<span class="lit-string">5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.</span>
<span class="lit-string">6. Disclaimer of Warranty</span>

<span class="lit-string">Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.</span>
<span class="lit-string">7. Limitation of Liability</span>

<span class="lit-string">Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</span>
<span class="lit-string">8. Litigation</span>

<span class="lit-string">Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</span>
<span class="lit-string">9. Miscellaneous</span>

<span class="lit-string">This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</span>
<span class="lit-string">10. Versions of the License</span>

<span class="lit-string">10.1. New Versions</span>

<span class="lit-string">Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.</span>
<span class="lit-string">10.2. Effect of New Versions</span>

<span class="lit-string">You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.</span>
<span class="lit-string">10.3. Modified Versions</span>

<span class="lit-string">If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).</span>
<span class="lit-string">10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses</span>

<span class="lit-string">If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</span>
<span class="lit-string">Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice</span>

<span class="lit-string">This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.</span>
<span class="lit-string">If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.</span>
<span class="lit-string">You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.</span>
<span class="lit-string">Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice</span>

<span class="lit-string">This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.</span>

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="lit-string">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</span>

<span class="lit-string">a) 	You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

<span class="lit-string">b) 	You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and</span>

<span class="lit-string">c) 	You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</span>

<span class="lit-string">d) 	If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="lit-string">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="lit-string">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="lit-string">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>
<span class="lit-string">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="lit-string">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="lit-string">1. uniuri</span>
<span class="lit-string">Written in 2011-2014 by Dmitry Chestnykh</span>


<span class="lit-string">Terms of the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0 1.0):</span>
<span class="lit-string">--------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="lit-string">Statement of Purpose</span>

<span class="lit-string">The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").</span>

<span class="lit-string">Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.</span>

<span class="lit-string">For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</span>

<span class="lit-string">1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:</span>

<span class="lit-string">i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;</span>

<span class="lit-string">ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);</span>

<span class="lit-string">iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;</span>

<span class="lit-string">iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;</span>

<span class="lit-string">v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;</span>

<span class="lit-string">vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and</span>

<span class="lit-string">vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.</span>

<span class="lit-string">2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</span>

<span class="lit-string">3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</span>

<span class="lit-string">4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</span>
<span class="lit-string">a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.</span>

<span class="lit-string">b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.</span>

<span class="lit-string">c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.</span>

<span class="lit-string">All software in this package is part of YottaDB (http://yottadb.com) each file of which contains notices from its copyright holders. YottaDB is provided to you under the terms of a license that you must comply with. If there is a COPYING file included in this package, it contains the terms of the license under which the package is provided to you.</span>

<span class="lit-string">If there is not a COPYING file in the package, you must do one of the following:</span>
<span class="lit-string"> (a) Ensure that there is a signed license under which the software is made available to you.</span>
<span class="lit-string"> (b) Create a COPYING file by copying the contents of https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.txt and use it as the license.</span>

<span class="lit-string">With free / open source software, the question arises from time to time as to whether an application that uses software licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License must itself use that license or a compatible license. For clarity, our view is:</span>
<span class="lit-string"> (a) If you distribute software that uses, or is built on, unmodified YottaDB software, that software is not a covered work. Simple recompilation of YottaDB software from unmodified sources also results in an unmodified YottaDB software.</span>
<span class="lit-string"> (b) If you distribute software that uses, or is built on, a modified version of YottaDB software, your modified version of YottaDB software is a covered work, and the source code to your modified version must be made available per the terms of the license. However that part of the software not required to build the modified version of YottaDB software can be part of an aggregate with the modified version of YottaDB software and made available under a different, unrelated license.</span>
<span class="lit-string"> (c) Distributing software that is covered and software is not covered in separate directories or folders suffices to create an aggregate with separable licenses.</span>
