<span class="comment"> Package gitignore implements matching file system paths to gitignore patterns that</span><span class="comment"> can be automatically read from a git repository tree in the order of definition</span><span class="comment"> priorities. It support all pattern formats as specified in the original gitignore</span><span class="comment"> documentation, copied below:</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">   Pattern format</span><span class="comment">   ==============</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\") in front of</span><span class="comment">		  the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("\").</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded</span><span class="comment">		  by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to</span><span class="comment">		  re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.</span><span class="comment">		  Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so</span><span class="comment">		  any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are</span><span class="comment">		  defined. Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first "!" for patterns</span><span class="comment">		  that begin with a literal "!", for example, "\!important!.txt".</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the</span><span class="comment">		  following description, but it would only find a match with a directory.</span><span class="comment">		  In other words, foo/ will match a directory foo and paths underneath it,</span><span class="comment">		  but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo (this is consistent</span><span class="comment">		  with the way how pathspec works in general in Git).</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- If the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell glob</span><span class="comment">		  pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location</span><span class="comment">		  of the .gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not</span><span class="comment">		  from a .gitignore file).</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption</span><span class="comment">		  by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will</span><span class="comment">		  not match a / in the pathname. For example, "Documentation.html" matches</span><span class="comment">		  "Documentation/git.html" but not "Documentation/ppc/ppc.html" or</span><span class="comment">		  "tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html".</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example,</span><span class="comment">		  ".c" matches "cat-file.c" but not "mozilla-sha1/sha1.c".</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname</span><span class="comment">		may have special meaning:</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories.</span><span class="comment">		  For example, "*foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as</span><span class="comment">		  pattern "foo". "*foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar"</span><span class="comment">		  anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- A trailing "*" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches</span><span class="comment">		  all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the</span><span class="comment">		  .gitignore file, with infinite depth.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches</span><span class="comment">		  zero or more directories. For example, "ab" matches "a/b", "a/x/b",</span><span class="comment">		  "a/x/y/b" and so on.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		- Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">   Copyright and license</span><span class="comment">   =====================</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		Copyright (c) Oleg Sklyar, Silvertern and source{d}</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">		The package code was donated to source{d} to include, modify and develop</span><span class="comment">		further as a part of the `go-git` project, release it on the license of</span><span class="comment">		the whole project or delete it from the project.</span></div>
