<span class="comment"> Package config implements encoding and decoding of git config files.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	Configuration File</span><span class="comment"> 	------------------</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect</span><span class="comment"> 	the Git commands' behavior. The `.git/config` file in each repository</span><span class="comment"> 	is used to store the configuration for that repository, and</span><span class="comment"> 	`$HOME/.gitconfig` is used to store a per-user configuration as</span><span class="comment"> 	fallback values for the `.git/config` file. The file `/etc/gitconfig`</span><span class="comment"> 	can be used to store a system-wide default configuration.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing</span><span class="comment"> 	and the porcelains. The variables are divided into sections, wherein</span><span class="comment"> 	the fully qualified variable name of the variable itself is the last</span><span class="comment"> 	dot-separated segment and the section name is everything before the last</span><span class="comment"> 	dot. The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric</span><span class="comment"> 	characters and `-`, and must start with an alphabetic character.  Some</span><span class="comment"> 	variables may appear multiple times; we say then that the variable is</span><span class="comment"> 	multivalued.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	Syntax</span><span class="comment"> 	~~~~~~</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive; whitespaces are mostly</span><span class="comment"> 	ignored.  The '#' and ';' characters begin comments to the end of line,</span><span class="comment"> 	blank lines are ignored.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	The file consists of sections and variables.  A section begins with</span><span class="comment"> 	the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next</span><span class="comment"> 	section begins.  Section names are case-insensitive.  Only alphanumeric</span><span class="comment"> 	characters, `-` and `.` are allowed in section names.  Each variable</span><span class="comment"> 	must belong to some section, which means that there must be a section</span><span class="comment"> 	header before the first setting of a variable.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	Sections can be further divided into subsections.  To begin a subsection</span><span class="comment"> 	put its name in double quotes, separated by space from the section name,</span><span class="comment"> 	in the section header, like in the example below:</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	--------</span><span class="comment"> 		[section "subsection"]</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	--------</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters except</span><span class="comment"> 	newline (doublequote `"` and backslash can be included by escaping them</span><span class="comment"> 	as `\"` and `\\`, respectively).  Section headers cannot span multiple</span><span class="comment"> 	lines.  Variables may belong directly to a section or to a given subsection.</span><span class="comment"> 	You can have `[section]` if you have `[section "subsection"]`, but you</span><span class="comment"> 	don't need to.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	There is also a deprecated `[section.subsection]` syntax. With this</span><span class="comment"> 	syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower-case and is also</span><span class="comment"> 	compared case sensitively. These subsection names follow the same</span><span class="comment"> 	restrictions as section names.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section</span><span class="comment"> 	header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form</span><span class="comment"> 	'name = value' (or just 'name', which is a short-hand to say that</span><span class="comment"> 	the variable is the boolean "true").</span><span class="comment"> 	The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters</span><span class="comment"> 	and `-`, and must start with an alphabetic character.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	A line that defines a value can be continued to the next line by</span><span class="comment"> 	ending it with a `\`; the backquote and the end-of-line are</span><span class="comment"> 	stripped.  Leading whitespaces after 'name =', the remainder of the</span><span class="comment"> 	line after the first comment character '#' or ';', and trailing</span><span class="comment"> 	whitespaces of the line are discarded unless they are enclosed in</span><span class="comment"> 	double quotes.  Internal whitespaces within the value are retained</span><span class="comment"> 	verbatim.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	Inside double quotes, double quote `"` and backslash `\` characters</span><span class="comment"> 	must be escaped: use `\"` for `"` and `\\` for `\`.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	The following escape sequences (beside `\"` and `\\`) are recognized:</span><span class="comment"> 	`\n` for newline character (NL), `\t` for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB)</span><span class="comment"> 	and `\b` for backspace (BS).  Other char escape sequences (including octal</span><span class="comment"> 	escape sequences) are invalid.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	Includes</span><span class="comment"> 	~~~~~~~~</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	You can include one config file from another by setting the special</span><span class="comment"> 	`include.path` variable to the name of the file to be included. The</span><span class="comment"> 	variable takes a pathname as its value, and is subject to tilde</span><span class="comment"> 	expansion.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	The included file is expanded immediately, as if its contents had been</span><span class="comment"> 	found at the location of the include directive. If the value of the</span><span class="comment"> 	`include.path` variable is a relative path, the path is considered to be</span><span class="comment"> 	relative to the configuration file in which the include directive was</span><span class="comment"> 	found.  See below for examples.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 	Example</span><span class="comment"> 	~~~~~~~</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 		# Core variables</span><span class="comment"> 		[core]</span><span class="comment"> 			; Don't trust file modes</span><span class="comment"> 			filemode = false</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 		# Our diff algorithm</span><span class="comment"> 		[diff]</span><span class="comment"> 			external = /usr/local/bin/diff-wrapper</span><span class="comment"> 			renames = true</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 		[branch "devel"]</span><span class="comment"> 			remote = origin</span><span class="comment"> 			merge = refs/heads/devel</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 		# Proxy settings</span><span class="comment"> 		[core]</span><span class="comment"> 			gitProxy="ssh" for "kernel.org"</span><span class="comment"> 			gitProxy=default-proxy ; for the rest</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> 		[include]</span><span class="comment"> 			path = /path/to/foo.inc ; include by absolute path</span><span class="comment"> 			path = foo ; expand "foo" relative to the current file</span><span class="comment"> 			path = ~/foo ; expand "foo" in your `$HOME` directory</span><span class="comment"></span></div>
