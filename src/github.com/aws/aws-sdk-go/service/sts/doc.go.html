Virginia) region. AWS recommends using</span><span class="comment"> Regional AWS STS endpoints instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency,</span><span class="comment"> build in redundancy, and increase session token validity. For more information,</span><span class="comment"> see Managing AWS STS in an AWS Region (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html)</span><span class="comment"> in the IAM User Guide.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> Most AWS Regions are enabled for operations in all AWS services by default.</span><span class="comment"> Those Regions are automatically activated for use with AWS STS.

You cannot activate the STS</span><span class="comment"> endpoint for a Region that is disabled. Tokens that are valid in all AWS</span><span class="comment"> Regions are longer than tokens that are valid in Regions that are enabled</span><span class="comment"> by default.

AWS STS recommends that you provide both the Region</span><span class="comment"> and endpoint when you make calls to a Regional endpoint. You can provide</span><span class="comment"> the Region alone for manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong</span><span class="comment"> Kong). In this case, the calls are directed to the STS Regional endpoint.</span><span class="comment"> However, if you provide the Region alone for Regions enabled by default,</span><span class="comment"> the calls are directed to the global endpoint of https://sts.amazonaws.com.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> To view the list of AWS STS endpoints and whether they are active by default,</span><span class="comment"> see Writing Code to Use AWS STS Regions (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#id_credentials_temp_enable-regions_writing_code)</span><span class="comment"> in the IAM User Guide.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> Recording API requests</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for</span><span class="comment"> your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.

For more information, see Turning On CloudTrail in Additional Regions</span><span class="comment"> (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/aggregating_logs_regions_turn_on_ct.html)</span><span class="comment"> in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a global service with a single endpoint</span><span class="comment"> at https://sts.amazonaws.com. Calls to this endpoint are logged as calls</span><span class="comment"> to a global service. However, because this endpoint is physically located</span><span class="comment"> in the US East (N.

CloudTrail does not write these logs to the US East (Ohio) Region</span><span class="comment"> unless you choose to include global service logs in that Region. CloudTrail</span><span class="comment"> writes calls to all Regional endpoints to their respective Regions. For example,</span><span class="comment"> calls to sts.us-east-2.amazonaws.com are published to the US East (Ohio)</span><span class="comment"> Region and calls to sts.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com are published to the EU</span><span class="comment"> (Frankfurt) Region.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your</span><span class="comment"> log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html).</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/sts-2011-06-15 for more information on this service.</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> See sts package documentation for more information.</span><span class="comment"> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/sts/</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> Using the Client</span><span class="comment"></span><span class="comment"> To contact AWS Security Token Service with the SDK use the New function to create</span><span class="comment"> a new service client.
