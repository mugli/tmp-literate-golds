		These constants determine the current version of this module.

		For our release process, we enforce the following rules:
			* Tagged releases use a tag that is identical to String.
			* Tagged releases never reference a commit where the String
			contains "devel".
			* The set of all commits in this repository where String
			does not contain "devel" must have a unique String.

		Steps for tagging a new release:
			1. Create a new CL.

			2. Update Minor, Patch, and/or PreRelease as necessary.
			PreRelease must not contain the string "devel".

			3. Since the last released minor version, have there been any changes to
			generator that relies on new functionality in the runtime?
			If yes, then increment RequiredGenerated.

			4. Since the last released minor version, have there been any changes to
			the runtime that removes support for old .pb.go source code?
			If yes, then increment SupportMinimum.

			5. Send out the CL for review and submit it.
			Note that the next CL in step 8 must be submitted after this CL
			without any other CLs in-between.

			6. Tag a new version, where the tag is is the current String.

			7. Write release notes for all notable changes
			between this release and the last release.

			8. Create a new CL.

			9. Update PreRelease to include the string "devel".
			For example: "" -&gt; "devel" or "rc.1" -&gt; "rc.1.devel"

			10. Send out the CL for review and submit it.
